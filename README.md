# Jupyter Images

> See <https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/master/components/example-notebook-servers> for more information.

This repository contains the Dockerfiles for the Jupyter images that can be used in kubeflow.

There are currently 8 different images:

- jupyter lab
  - basic [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) image
  - JupyterLab image with [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
  - JupyterLab image with [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)
  - JupyterLab image with [text-generation-inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)
- codeserver
  - basic [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) image
  - code-server image with [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
  - code-server image with [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)
  - code-server image with [text-generation-inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)

The basic idea is that we provide images with some complicated dependencies pre-installed, so that users can get started with their work without having to worry about the installation process. These complicated dependencies includes:

- PyTorch: not too difficult to install, but it's a large package and it takes a long time.
- DeepSpeed: requires compile from source to enable all features, which has complicated dependency matrix.
- text-generation-inference: requires to build a lot of kernels, while provides an ease-to-use Docker image. We leverage its Docker image.
